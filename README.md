A Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the potential profit of a business based on variable costs, demand, and fixed costs. It models costs like direct costs (c1), parts costs (c2), and demand using random distributions, then computes profits over 1 million simulations.

# **Key Features**:
- **Maximum, Minimum, and Average Profit** calculations.
- **Probability of Loss and Profit**.
